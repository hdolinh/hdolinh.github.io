Hello! I am an environmental data scientist with a multidisciplinary background who cares about urban environmental systems and the people within them. Usually you can find me in the mountains, but this summer I'm closer to the ocean building an interactive R Shiny dashboard for the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. 

This June, I graduated from UCSB's [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/) program. For [my capstone](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects/ensuring-equitable-access-outdoor-recreation-evaluating-spatiotemporal-patterns-and-trends), I built a Shiny app to support federal public land managers efforts to ensure equitable access to campgrounds on federal public lands in California. It's called the [Outdoor Equity App](https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/oe_app/) and is live - check it out to explore relationships between campsite reservations and socioeconomic demographic data.

Click around and I look forward to connecting with you.
