      "contents": "\nHalina Do-Linh achieved a Bachelor’s Degree in Environmental\nStudies & Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz\n(UCSC). There she grew her interests in sustainable\ndevelopment, field research and conservation.\n\n\nHer interest in an environmental career was solidified after\nresearching green and hawksbill sea turtles in Baja California through\nthe Ecology and Conservation Supercourse field quarter\nat UC Santa Cruz.\n\n\nAfter graduating, Halina applied her field research\nskills to outdoor education, where she taught\nenvironmental topics to K-12 students and later, field\nresearch methods to University of California\nundergraduates.\n\n\nIn 2018, she moved to Los Angeles to work for Heal the Bay,\nan environmental non-profit focused on safe, clean water. There\nshe garnered support for environmental campaigns including the\nSafe, Clean Water Program (Measure W) and The\nCalifornia Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act\n(SB 54 and AB 1080). These campaigns expanded Halina’s\nknowledge of watershed health, environmental justice, and\nenvironmental policy. Though these campaigns were successful,\nshe recognized there were data inaccuracies in representation and in\nmetrics.\n\n\n\nTo gain the skills to overcome these data challenges, Halina is\nstudying Environmental\nData Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science &\nManagement. After Bren, Halina plans to apply her training\nin data science to finding equitable solutions for environmental issues\naffecting urban watersheds.\n\n\n\n",
