Halina Do-Linh achieved a Bachelor’s Degree in Environmental Studies & Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz. She graduated with the expectation of becoming a field researcher studying how land management practices impact biodiversity. After graduating, she obtained two seasonal positions centered on outdoor science education - one where she taught broad environmental topics to students K-12 and the other teaching field research methods to University of California undergraduate students. In 2018, she moved to Los Angeles to work for Heal the Bay, an environmental non-profit focused on safe, clean water advocacy and policy. At Heal the Bay, she garnered support for environmental campaigns such as the Safe, Clean Water Program (Measure W), MPA Watch, and The California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act (SB 54 and AB 1080). These work experiences demonstrated to her the importance of the intersection between climate change and environmental justice. As of August 2020, Halina is a Master’s candidate at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management studying Environmental Data Science. She has a long-term goal of applying data science to science communications to ensure that environmental science is equitable, accessible, and accurate.
